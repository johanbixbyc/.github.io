		<h3> sun's disaster </h3>
		<p> A work in progress </p>
		<br> </br>
		<p> I awoke at noon on an odious day, drenched in sweat, with the sun bolting through the blinds into my eyes. - Fate’s sanctimonious entreat. - A poor scythe farmer I would make, complete with heat exhaustion, starvation, and either crime or death. I would choose death. Though I don’t know everything about myself, how can I really say what I would or wouldn’t do? Feverish and near vomiting, I rolled out of the light and out of my bed, and fell to the ground with hardly a thud. </p>
		<p> Laying there, - A self-languisher, I am.
</p>
		<p> - How I yearn to be entirely myself, but a different one from who I am.
</p>
		<p> James Cook being ripped apart by the Hawaiins, a fatal mistake on the one hand to try and dominate when you are an explorer, an arrogant choice in 2 ways, remembered, even worse, as an arrogant man. Having a ruined legacy is worse than death.
</p>
		<p> Aguirre, the Wrath of God - if nothing else, interesting. The frightening debasement of the conqueror, the failed emperor, arrogance casting one into a fate worse than death, devolution, deconstruction, return to the state of nature as primate, as lunatic. But what about the successful? Evil, sure, horrific, sure, but still blessed to have won, or at least regarded as sane, or even smart. What does that say about us? To regard those who fail to match the scale of destruction of others are remembered as being subhuman, and those who do succeed take upon mythic levels of infamy and somehow respect - they aren’t treated as though they stand outside of human language and understanding all together, as insane, no. And at the same time, we see the same things as Aguirre, as conquistadors: the unknown. If nothing else, the compulsion is interesting - I feel the draw beyond the limits of human understanding, and the knowledge that taking one more step would pass you beyond: irresistible.
</p>
		<p> - How many little Caligulas are there in a crowd? How many little Caligulas judge other little Caligulas and big Caligulas for acting on opportunities they haven’t been given? How much judgement is jealousy watching other people fulfill their opportunism, mixed with a savage cruelty reined in only by the miserable forces outside of their control, and then called “temperance”?
</p>
		<p> As I laid on the ground, thinking to myself, I became sicker and sicker. I didn’t know what to make of my own thoughts: whether or not I was a petulant child stuck in an adult's body, or if I was on the right track, accidents, resentment, and my own pitiful state aside. What was more, was that I felt like I was right, that I took logical steps, but when I thought about the world I didn’t want to be: I didn’t want to be so aggressive, I didn’t want to be so contemptuous, and I believed in the possibility of a world full of love and family and friendship and earnestness, even when faced with constant cynicism and tragedy. I thought to myself, I am a romantic at heart, admitting it with something between pride and shame, as I thought about past professors, and friends, and peers, laughing at the naive and the romantic, as not only stupid or out of touch, but morally implicated as well, that romantic natures were accidental to capitalism, or were synonymous with collaborators and charlatans. “Her romanticism, her obsession with the past, and the effect that has on how she envisions her relationship with the all too stupid Ron Kirby played by the, somewhat laughable, Rock Hudson, makes her a part of not only a dying past, but a pitifully ignorant movement bent by an out of touch understanding of perfection and life, and she ends up pathetic in her inability to understand her situation and evolve”. I couldn’t figure out whether I was right or they were; I couldn’t tell if I was deluded, or they were; reality felt impossible for me: I was out of step.
</p>
		<p> I forced myself up off the ground, slapped my cheeks with both hands, and decided I was dehydrated from sweating all night, and that that was the reason I felt like shit. I pulled off my shirt, stepped carefully over the mess of boxes and empty plastic bottles of water on the ground as I walked into the kitchen, and looked for a bottle of water amongst the 
</p>
		<p> I tried to shake it from me, but I couldn’t. I couldn’t shake the thought of being wrong, of being lied to, of having misplaced my trust, of having all the things in my life be a facade covering up the fact that my life was collapsing all around me, that I was blind to my own failures, the miserableness of existence, and worst of all, the pitiful patheticness that I hated most in the world.
</p>
		<p> Nostalgia creeps into me, and I want to refuse to feel some sort of theoretically post-moralistic guilt over the fact that the intelligentsia, truly a cabal, and a cabal made true by the fact that, while imposters, they acted with such self-serving treachery, under the guise of some impartiality that allowed them harmony with the grand logical crystalline structure of the universe produced in theory (philoso-scientists: an enigma, you’d think they’d notice the somewhat contradicting terms), that they won through the force of their willpower, which I do admire and honestly feel jealous towards which perhaps clouds my judgement but what else am I to do but judge, not judge?, but nonetheless I do feel it, I do feel bad being nostalgic, I do feel stupid, I do feel sentimental, even though I am sentimental, I am nostalgic, and likely I am stupid too, and I get stuck in some catholic-protestant division question of: can I change, and what should I feel bad about?, and I don’t know too much how to get out of such a ditch other than saying I don’t care, maybe sometimes through some logical philosophical techniques and thought processes but generally its too tiring to go about one’s daily life filled with having to fight endless philosophical battles for the value of my soul and brain against some enemy I’m not even sure is worthy, and today I will say I don’t care.</p>
		<p> As a child, I remember walking alongside the side of the old middle school building from the aquatic center with my mom, holding her hand, and would look at the side, the classrooms and doors and bricks, the kids that were older than me and bigger than me and who I was afraid of, and would think that someday I would go here, that I was going to get older, that I was getting older, noticeably older, every year, and in just a few years I would be inside this building, going to different classes, which is different from elementary school, and I would have to be responsible for looking at my own map, and for finding my own classroom, and then going to my classrooms, going to lunch on my own, finishing up my day without any recess, and going home, like the bigger kids do. I would hope that the bigger kids wouldn’t pick on me or my mom, that they wouldn’t swear or do something bad, or harass us in any way as we walked home. I would look at the trees across from the school, the forested pit, with rundown houses and a small swamp,
</p>
		<p> I stepped through the brush, carefully pulling branches back and making sure my ankles didn’t touch long grass in case of ticks, and through the little path. Around the final bend, I found the noises. Teenagers were playing in a river, yelling, screaming, and laughing. I watched as one would run across the beach and prance into the river, flailing their legs. I wasn’t going to walk up to them; not only was I scared: I had passed into adulthood, what would someone think about a man approaching teens, but I also had no reason to, I had just wanted to see what the noise was, though it did make me happy seeing the group being so happy. But as I watched, they kept running, prancing, flailing, as though they were trying to walk on water, then laughing, and as I kept watching, I picked up on the fact that they coalesced into a more or less single file line, where each knew the order, each was patient, each supported the one at the front, and would line up in the back, which was less strict in the organization of its shape than the front. Run, prance, flail, laugh, stand up, shake the water off, then step to the back, and laugh with the others, then watch the next.
