		<p> My name is Johan Christensen, and I'm a writer based in Seattle.</p>
		<p> I hold an MA in philosophy from the University of Chicago and completed my MA thesis under the advisement of Linda Zerilli. While earning my degree, I focused on taking classes on the intersections between philosophy, political theory, and public policy, including classes outside the Humanities in the Law School and Social Science department. My coursework includes 'Feminist Philosophy', wherein I argued for various legal and philosophical positions during the final exam, after a careful study of philosophical texts and case law both inside and outside of the classroom. This course was taught by Martha Nussbaum at the University of Chicago Law School. After completing my Master's degree, I taught essay writing and argument structure to first-year students as part of the University of Chicago's core Humanities courses. I taught within both 'Human Being and Citizen' and 'Language and the Human'. At the start of the pandemic, I returned home to Washington.</p>
		<p> I have strong interests in many things, and work hard to continue to learn, both new skills and about the world in general. Currently in my personal time I'm working on a videogame while learning C#, and learning to play tennis.</p>
		<p> I am deeply passionate about helping people, whether that be through teaching, activism, or volunteer work. </p>
		<p> In addition to my more serious projects, I like to make short films with my friends, make all sorts of music, and find new parks and trails in my area that I haven't visited yet. I also like to work on small projects, such as this website, which I built from scratch in HTML.</p>
