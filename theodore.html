		<h3> Theodore </h3>
		<p> A work in progress </p>
		<br> </br>
		<p> Although my father and I had been somewhat estranged for years before his death, I had immediately boarded a plane back home once I got the phone call telling me that my dad had died. Years have passed, but whenever I think back to it, I still feel a vague tenseness creep up within me - whether it is guilt, remorse, or another feeling, I don’t know. I just know that when I think back to my treatment of him while he was alive, and the fact that I immediately, before the funeral, tore through his belongings, I start to feel how my eyes move around, and I lose my ability to focus on the outside world. 
</p>
		<p> At the time, it all had felt extremely matter of fact. I suppose it remains that way for me - I do not consider myself plagued by guilt - that I should open all of the boxes, drawers, and closets of the last member of my family seems to me a right bestowed upon me, but with less ritual and grace. It felt, strangely, like a duty. 
</p>
		<p> There were not many surprises. There were some things in my father’s boxes that would surely shock some people, and might make for some kind of story even, but in the moment they seemed as fact of the matter as my own behavior, walking around the familiar hallways of the house I grew up in and rifling through my father’s room. Moreover, how can one truly be sickened to their core with some sense of innocence and disgust; none of us live up to some sick sense of perfection. Everyone has moments in their lives for which they, in retrospect, harshly judge themselves - why pretend another’s are so different, or so much worse, or worse, that their own don’t exist, or matter? Indeed, it seems natural to constantly destroy or bury or alter our memories of our pasts in order to construct a perfect image of ourselves above reproach in every situation, a process of becoming something that necessarily has always been perfect, if evidenced only, not by our attacks, but with the enthusiasm, and clear enjoyment, we and those around us take from being the attacker. In the case of the death of my father, there was nothing to attack anymore. All I had left were memories of him walking in these same hallways, some terrible ones, but none of that mattered to me in the moment - there was only my sense of duty towards knowing everything there was to know about him.
</p>
		<p> Everything in my father’s room retained that childish reverence one has for a parent, of their awesomeness, and if I thought about it more at the time, I might have been stopped by it, but no. In a way, it was as though being the eldest son, let alone the only son, and the last living member of my family, granted me a kind of transcendence and authority to know everything there is to know about everything pertaining to me, without casting a single judgement upon them - in that way I was somewhat cold. </p>
		<p> In fact, I hardly ever feel guilt, in a way some might call horrifyingly amoral, but which I consider to be appropriate, that is, I command myself to learn from every twinge of my self-consciousness, whether that be guilt or stupidity, and believe there to be an innocence in becoming, which we cannot judge, not even when it concerns ourselves, so along as we change.
</p>
		<p> One of the boxes I opened contained dozens of old photographs, dating back over a hundred years. I didn’t recognize a single one, but as I looked through, it was clear that there were some repeating figures. There was a blurry daguerreotype - clearly the oldest photo there - of a family sitting together. There was a photo of a man posing in front of a farmhouse, and another photo of the same farmhouse and a family. These seemed to be the next oldest photos, and I tried to piece together who these people were from whatever tidbits, flashes of images, sounds of words disconnected from any meaning, might be floating around in my memory. Crouched down on the floor, I closed my eyes trying to recall anytime my father might have showed me these photos, even if only in passing, maybe back when I was a young child, too young to understand but for whom you anyway show and explain things, he showed me these photos on his way to place them where I would come to find them. I didn’t want to call this a false memory, but I anyway wouldn’t say that I had memories of seeing these photos before. I wondered for a moment how many times my father had looked at these photos.
</p>
		<p> As I dug around the box, pulling out more and more photos, I found sheets of notes. The notes were as such: a description of a photo, a name or names, a description of the place, and an approximate date. The names were all ones I’d heard, but never thought much of. Perhaps that was part of being from a family of working class people - not much weight is given to your heritage and your ancestors when you don’t have some signifier of importance. Death has lost a lot of people to time. I pulled out the daguerreotype again. This was the oldest photo in the box, meaning these were the oldest members of my family I’d ever see. I wondered what their parents looked like, and their parents, on and on throughout history, the constant erosion and eventual destruction of faces, words, meanings, stories, and their memory. As I stared at the photograph, my thoughts changed towards the people in the photograph - their clothes had some slight frays, and their photographer was evidently not the best, or maybe my family unruly, or maybe just dumb luck, because their faces were near indescernible. Hardly worth paying for, and yet must have. It must have been an event, this new invention, a wonder really, to capture light on a plate of metal, coming to town - imagining their disappointment nearly brought a tear to my eye. But I felt better when I thought of myself looking at it - their attempt to leave something for posterity worked. It wasn’t a letter, but it still felt like it was talking to me. I thought about how sometimes we consider photos of ourselves to be vain, and maybe people considered it vain then too, to want to leave someone they’d never meet a photo of themselves. But it was as though they were with me. At first I thought I sensed their will to live - their attempt at some sort of immortality, some immortalization. Then I thought it was more a will to be remembered - no foolish want to live forever. Then I thought both these were wrong, and what I sensed was the fact that they willed.
</p>
		<p> I found myself in tears, and became consumed with guilt in that instant for the estrangement I had had with my father, and the fact that I cried over these photos before I cried over him. Those tears, which confused me when I asked myself whether they were real or crocodilian, quickly answered my question by making me forget that I had ever asked, and transformed from tears of guilt to the purest sort of crying and screaming and writhing.
</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p> I recalled these memories as I drove into Northfield, on my way to visit the library and rifle through their photo archives, wondering whether there was something wrong with my interest in old photographs when the beginning of this hobby of mine, scouring through old photographs in the local libraries of small towns, is the death of my father, the end of my estrangement with my living family, and the beginning of my new loneliness. Obviously, I thought to myself and laughed. But it was much less clear to me then what I was to do about it - it was as though I had a puzzle piece but didn’t have a puzzle. I didn’t know how adults solve their problems, I didn’t know what the mature thing to do was, and I didn’t have any path set out before me to walk into being right. The ambiguity in what I was to do next made me feel stupid, rotten, and childish - someone who couldn’t figure it out, couldn’t even read the rules, much less follow them, and couldn’t take the final steps in adulthood as everyone else managed. I could see all the pieces set out before me, but couldn’t place them together, as though I would only ever be able to act right - I only could pretend to be good and get it. I was only destined for failure... I was missing something human...  An ersatz man...
</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p> In the reflection in the small quarter of the window, I saw the librarian standing in the doorway behind me. I turned to face him, and as I did, he smiled.
</p>
		<p> “Oh oh, don’t let me interrupt you.” He said, turning and making to leave.
</p>
		<p> “Oh no, it's no problem, no problem at all!” I called back.
</p>
		<p> The man slowly walked over, smiling at me. He looked at the large prints and touched them with his hand. A twinge of consternation shot through me as I watched his hand trembling while he reached over the table to grab hold of a print.
</p>
		<p> “It's not often people look through our photo archives - in fact I don’t remember the last time someone did. It must have been some years ago.” He smiled as he pushed past the top photographs and looked through the pile I had made. I could sense a boyish excitement within him that I was down here, but he kept it reserved. His head slowly, and with somewhat jagged jerks, turned from the sheets of photos on the table back to me. “Do you like photography?” 
</p>
		<p> “Yes, very much so. I’ve been a photographer myself for quite a while, but I’m very interested in old photos like these. It's incredible to me to be able to look into a photo and look back in time.”</p>
		<p> “Oh yes, oh yes.. Oh, especially these ones...” he said, trailing off, while staring into the stack. “The oldest photos we have here are from around 1880. At my home, we have some even older photos... of Seattle in the 1860s and 1870s”.</p>
		<p> “Seattle?”</p>
		<p> The man laughed a little. “A little odd I know. It's where I’m from.”
</p>
		<p> “You’re from Seattle? How odd, I’m also from Seattle! How strange that we meet out all the way out here - not only on a different coast, but a bit” - I wanted to avoid offending him so I didn’t say out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere like I was thinking - “of a trip from somewhere like Boston or Pittsburgh”.
</p>
		<p> The man laughed a little at this too. “Well, I’ll be. That is odd! What are the chances.. We west-coasters meet out here.. How’s she holding up these days?”
</p>
		<p> “Seattle?”</p>
		<p> “Yes”</p>
		<p> “She’s good, I think. I don’t know - I don’t really want to be out there anymore, so I haven’t been in a while.” Since my father had died. “It’s changed a lot since I was a kid -” </p>
		<p> “You’re telling me it's changed! No kidding - what you remember as the groundwork, as your Seattle, is a different one from mine! You’re the change kid!” He teased with a smile, lifting his hand and pointing at me. “You’re the change man!” he said with an enormous grin.
</p>
		<p> “That’s true, that’s true!” I laughed. Although I went along with his teasing, saw and got the humor, something about what he had said made me nervous. I was filled with the urge to prove myself to the man, to show that I wasn’t just some whisper on the wind that had haphazardly destroyed his childhood home. “Though I will say, I think its changed dramatically recently. Lots of those mega-businesses like Amazon and Microsoft have bought up so much land and driven up prices, while the sleaziest apartment developers move in and buy up what’s left, build as many buildings as they can as fast as they can, not taking the time to have them look any different than all the rest, use the cheapest materials, and then sell 2 bedroom condos for 800 thousand dollars in places where family homes had sold for 200 thousand 20 years ago. A lot of my friends have had to move out of town because they can’t afford it anymore.”
</p>
		<p> “Mm..”</p>
		<p> I reorganized the sheets of photos back into the original order I had found them and placed them back into the box. Theodore then motioned to hand him the box, and he slowly walked over to the shelf and carefully placed it back where it belonged. I put on my coat as he walked over to the staircase and pointed up.</p>
		<p> “I’m going to go up and into the office and put on my coat. You can look around a bit more, if you would like, I’ll be a few minutes.”</p>
		<p> “Ok” I said.</p>
		<p> Theodore held onto the handrail and made his way up and out of sight and I was alone again. I didn’t really have the time to enjoy the photos, and in any case, my mind was elsewhere. I looked around the room. The age of the building sank into me as I looked at the cracking white paint on the walls, and listened to the hum of the white fluorescent bulbs. Behind the cracks and the paint, at an unknown depth, laid the 300 year old brick foundation of the library, built to be a church. I wondered what this room had been 300 years ago - before it was an examination room.</p>
		<p> Back in Bellevue, when I was a teenager, I volunteered at a local music venue called Ground Zero. It was partnered with the Boys and Girls Club, and was specifically to be ran by teens. It was founded in the 90s, I was told, something like an Eastside (of Lake Washington) outpost for Seattle grunge and punk, especially important when Seattle implemented Teen Dance Ordinances, prohibiting 
</p>
		<p> And now, years later, you can hardly google or otherwise research anything related to Ground Zero and its history. What's left is memories, photos, the ground upon which old buildings stood, some guitars and other objects, all only brought to life by talking. Talking brings our memories to life again - the thing is gone, we remember not to return to the exact state of the way things were, but in remembering we create for ourselves new ways of looking at the fragments we have - and in doing so, talking about the way things were, we feel something new, something different than recalling the exact nature of what was. So marches obliviation, by the stopping of our talking of our memories, and leaving all there is in a quiet beyond quiet - death beyond death: the loss of our ability to call something a memory, to talk about something, and give it life again. The destruction of all the signs that something, or someone, was. Slowly, the thing that was so important to me and others was fading away, getting erased in part by the active decisions of opportunists and capitalists, but also by other important things in the lives of me and my friends, and everyone else involved. We cannot notice, it is nonsensical to say that we could, the active decay of our memories - we can only think back and see how much distance there is between us, how much we have lost, and how much the world has changed. 
</p>
		<p> “Time and destruction hinge heavily on your intuition. What do you say when you break something? What do you say when someone breaks something of yours? It lies in our reactions, our instincts - we say what we think, the way in which we see the world, and we say what we feel. We can’t say anything more. We might like to tell ourselves we are in tune with some sort of underground logic that runs through everything we say and do. But what about the times when we’ve changed our minds? The world view that seemed so necessary and important and that only made sense through the fact that it was logical, is now gone, no longer necessary, stupid even - we have our new view and vision, our new responses, suddenly filled with a necessity that they didn’t have before, from when they were outside of our way of dealing with the world. Do we just keep going down that spiral, stopping on every step? Is there an end? What if at the end, we find ourselves back at the beginning again? How do we figure our mistakes into logic? What makes logic necessary to our lives? If we can live, enjoy our lives, support our friends, love our families - what does logic have to do with anything? Isn’t logic a language too? We use logic like a tool - tools have purposes, uses, and not everyone works everywhere. Sometimes you can’t think your way out of a problem. How can the way in which one lives be illogical unto itself? When do we ask that question? When do we want to say you’re wrong or illogical or a way of life doesn't make any sense? What happens when we say it - what are we doing when we say it? children? Are children’s views of the world wrong? And more importantly - when do we find ourselves answering and asking that question? 
</p>
		<p> “Everywhere you look there’s destruction - there’s a misplaced weight on what we do and say, by those who damn people instead of time. A change is destruction, but so, and just as much too, is preservation, or returning to the past. Each are facades - to want to preserve a world is to want to deny time just as much as it is to deny the needs of people in the world to grow up, get a job, move to a new place, and so on; to return is worse - to return is to destroy the present, and the future, and falsify the past. All we can ever have are remnants. But what we can do, that’s what's important. We do things with our memories - we do things based on what we think and how we feel about the world. That’s important. Like right now we’re talking - that’s important. A world is gone - but what it's done to make us is right there, in you. All the people I’ve ever met are right here.” Peter tapped at his head, and then brought his shaking hand down to his chest, tapped at his heart, and smiled. “They’re right here. And now they’re in you too. Thank you. Thank you for listening. It won’t be the same, but as I said: that’s ok. Thank you.”
</p>
		<p> I was stunned. 
</p>
		<p> “What about that instinct though - to preserve and keep and cherish what we do have? Why did we talk about old photos and talk about old buildings? Are we just fools?”
	“Though, in another voice, I’d like to say: yes, we are fools. And that’s ok. There’s no avoiding one’s destruction.”
</p>
		<p> “What some people can’t accept is that to be a person at all means to be full of contradictions. We say one thing and do another all the time - everytime we get to a new situation, its exactly that: new. Different. Maybe we do something a little different than the last time something similar happened. But as much as they might be like one another, they’re still different. 
</p>
		<p> Its hard to say that people can’t accept that their world is wrong, or that they see the world wrong; they might hold logic deeply close to their chest, even if they don’t realize it.</p>
		<p> I don’t think you can say that.</p>
		<p> What? Why not?</p>
		<p> What’s the truth?</p>
		<p> That there’s neither logic nor no logic to the world.
</p>
		<p> Isn’t there?</p>
		<p> 	What do you mean? Didn’t you just spend all this time pointing that out to me?
</p>
		<p> 	Not in my mind, no.
</p>
		<p> 	Then wh-what are you saying? I don’t understand - I thought people couldn’t accept the truth that there isn’t some grand logic to the world that their lives are built upon, that they tap into, and see the world through?</p>
		<p> 	That I could agree with, perhaps.</p>
		<p> Then what do you mean? Doesn’t that mean there isn’t logic?</p>
		<p> When is a time you would say that the world is logical?</p>
		<p> I thought for a moment. Oddly, my head felt nearly entirely empty. </p>
		<p> I don’t think you can say that they’re wrong because they can’t accept the truth. I’m not here to push truth, that’s the opposite of what I wanna do with my time left. If I’m going to preach anything its going to be holding what’s important to you close to you - its going to be: change the problems that you see. Turn yourself into what you want to be. Push yourself. Its all you can do. I’m not here to say: wait around for the world to be the world you think it should. Too many people live like that. I could say I understand it, but I don’t want to understand it anymore.</p>
