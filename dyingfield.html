		<h3> A Dying Field </h3>
		<br> </br>
		<p> Peter set his black overcoat down haphazardly on the arm of the chair and slumped down into the seat, staring out the floor-to-ceiling window out upon the cold Iowa landscape. The lifeless field, that last week had been only dark, frozen, soil, old track marks, and the sparse yellowed remnants of corn stalks, was now cloaked with snow. Only a few pale shoots jutted through.
</p>
		<p> The snow was late this year, which to Peter, meant that the State should have been even more prepared, seeing as how they must have been on their toes, waiting to begin to clear and salt the roads. But the incompetence of other people seemed to know no bounds, and due to a massive failure in the transportation department’s fleet of snow plows and salt trucks, the fault of which lay in a budget that forced the employment of decades old equipment paired nicely with low maintenance and monitoring, further amplified by a communication breakdown between the local and State authorities that caused the few working State trucks to arrive in places already cleared and salted by local officials, Peter’s bus ride to Chicago was cancelled, due to hazardous conditions. The streets to the North and the middle of nowhere: clear. The streets East to Chicago: not clear.
</p>
		<p>  Even though it was only to be for two nights, Peter had planned the trip for weeks - after finals and before his friends would fly home to New York and California had been the only option. The other times he had suggested, weekends and holidays, were filled with the classic UChicago “midterm” excuse. His friends told him on the phone all about their new girlfriends, new girlfriend problems, parties, who threw up where, and so on. The calls had the effect of making him excited to visit and watch as Tom drunkenly tried to guitar solo in front of everyone, in an attempt to woo a girl, while also feeding his resentment for Iowa. Every look upon that dearth of humanity made up of solitary houses, straight roads, and unending rows upon rows of corn, set to be harvested with machines with mouths of scythes, overfull pens of pigs squealing and sitting around in their own shit, waiting to be slaughtered and shipped off in little squares of meat in a never ending complex of trucks and planes to the rest of the country, confirmed his theory that Iowa was a place of stagnation. Nothing changed here, nothing human could exist here. Left forgotten. Peter’s suspicion was that here, the people could only ever be the mosquitos hovering around standing buckets of water on the far side of barns. 
</p>
		<p> Sitting and looking out this window at the scene of snow was the only place tolerable. The rest of the windows in the library either didn’t have a seat in which he could sit and gaze out, or worse, looked out at the rest of campus. Sitting there he’d have a huge view of the people he didn’t want to talk to walking around a campus that he couldn’t feel at home at. Chicago had its problems but he didn’t know how good he had it. And beyond the university, the rough outline of the buildings making up town was visible in the distance. It made Peter sick - like being insulated with asbestos.
</p>
		<p> Peter refreshed the bus site on his phone again and again. His frustration mounted. Nothing changed. He gripped the phone hard, to crush and kill the messenger. Again, the hope, any hope, of fun, any hope of relaxing... of feeling like I’m a real human being... has been ripped from me. Fighting back tears, he thought to himself, again, again, again.</p>
		<p> “Fuck this town” he said under his breath. He set down his phone and closed his eyes. Breathing in deeply, Peter sank into the old chair. No one else came to the library, no one could see him if he cried here. Every fiber in his body relaxed as he stretched his legs out, unfurled his body, and slowly let himself slip down. Any doctor would have looked away in horror at the position of Peter’s spine, but he kept slouching lower and lower until he finally slipped out and sat on the ground. Standing up, and wiping his eyes as though he’d just woken up from a deep sleep, Peter groaned. Blinking hard a few times, he looked back out the window at the silent field and regained the majority of his composure. As he put his coat back on and made to walk out of the library, he rolled his tongue around his teeth and rubbed his thumbs against his fore fingers in a fight between his old contempt and sadness threatening to break its repression.
</p>
		<p> Chicago, Chicago, Chicago. City lights climbed high into the night, people were awake in each window, people laughed all night. Laughing faces all hours of the night. People talking deeply, drinking, gossipping, walking along the lake in the snow bright darkness talking nothing, just moving lips, just living passing moments. Peter passed several people he’d seen in the library before in the hallway as he hurried out of the building. Their eyes met with clear recognition but it was unclear what they were to do or say, and Peter just turned away. He pushed the door open to the parking lot. The frozen morning air, the clearest air, gave him a little smack.
</p>
		<p> The sun shined right into his face. He brought his hand to his brow and covered his burning eyes as he waited for them to adjust to the blinding light. The sun was in the same place - he had been in the library for only 15 minutes. The fact that it was still morning, that he still had a day ahead of him, made his heart sink. The time would pass slowly, the minutes empty. A metronome ticking without a pianist. Restless and worthless. The air around him began to close in and pressed itself around his skull and chest, filling his lungs with lead shot. His heartbeat and breathing got faster and faster and faster. Am I going to throw up? There was an empty fluttering beneath his ribs, followed by the voiding of all blood from his heart, his heart’s scarlet walls had evanesced, spilling all of its dark contents into his chest cavity, dripping down into his stomach and intestines, now suddenly heavier as Peter was made conscious of gravity’s grip upon his vital organs. His head began to spin, and the thought of something being wrong with his heart flashed through his mind. Is this an arrythmia? Am I going to fall? Hit my head on the concrete?
</p>
		<p> Before he could, the cold sank deeper into the skin on his face. There was a far more urgent matter than any faulty heart: the need to get walking, get in his car, turn the heaters on full blast, and roast his hands, making sure to roast them evenly on both sides. Once hot, he’d slap them against his icey cheeks. Peter shivered once more, then sped across the lot. A giddiness grew inside him at the thought of warming up this way, and he let out a small laugh at the childness of it: a 23 year old graduate student skipping to his car to clap his hands against his cheeks. Then he jumped in, ripped off his gloves, and turned on the heat.
</p>
		<p> After driving the short distance home to his house, taking off his coat, and putting it nicely on the coat rack, Peter put on a pot of coffee and proceeded to entrench himself in his chair by the window. He looked out the pane of shotty glass onto the somewhat distorted street. The sky was totally absent of all clouds. You couldn’t understand the size of the sky in Chicago. Even at the lake, skyscrapers crept into view if you turned even just a little - you had to stare straight out at the water and, depending on where in the city you were, forget about your peripheral vision. Here, there was nothing to stop the sky, nothing to close it in - the tallest buildings in town only made sad attempts. In Iowa, the sky dominated the landscape. You could forget the sky in Chicago. Here, even when surrounded by walls, it was still there. In Iowa, the sky seemed to creep into the room. Wherever you went, there it was. An ever present watcher - Peter shuddered.
</p>
		<p> The coffee was ready. Peter poured himself a mug full and went back to his seat. 
</p>
		<p> He looked back towards the sky. They must be flying home right now, Peter thought. He pictured his friends bored on the plane, with restless legs while they tried to watch a movie, as they flew home to New York. Peter wondered if he’d be able to spot their planes in the sky. Nearly instantly he realized that Iowa was West of Illinois. Stupid. They wouldn’t even fly in his direction. </p>
		<p> All the time he had spent in Iowa, they had been living in Chicago. They had been hanging out amongst themselves, going to parties, dancing, going to shows, while Peter sat in his various chairs and dreamt of seeing them soon. A hint of resentment flared up in Peter, an image of a callous group who couldn’t care less about his existence, who wouldn’t treat him like he wanted to be treated, and couldn’t appreciate him for what he was. But the flicker died quickly. He refused to get angry at them because he was failing. Peter sighed to himself. He tried to map all the distortions and contortions of the glass in front of him. The house across the street warped and stretched as he moved his head to try and find the spots with the waves. The black windows swelled and bent, and though the black window should mean there was no one home, he felt an ominous presence, as if by staring he caught its attention, and it was staring back. The friends he dreamt about were in all likelihood just ephemeral ones. 
</p>
		<p> They’re all going home to their families. How much in that is duty, how much is love? Which of them see it as a chore? Which of them dread knocking on the door? Do any of them really, genuinely, want to go home and see their mom and dad, sister, brother? ... Is there always such a clear cut line? </p>
		<p> A nail drove itself into Peter’s tongue, and he grinded his teeth together. He looked down from the window and stared at the ground. From deep below even the recesses of the mind, from a tectonic plate upon which sat his personal Tartarus, a voice whispered out to him: 
</p>
		<p> “You don’t even have the option”</p>
		<p> Dead. Beneath the ground.</p>
		<p> “Shut up! Don’t say another goddamned word!” Peter’s father yelled. “You’re destroying us! You can’t fucking do one thing to save this family!” Peter ran to the other room and his father followed. “You’re the reason we fight, you’re the reason! If you could just do one thing, one little thing, but you don’t! But you don’t! You’re a waste!” Peter’s father followed him into a corner, screaming, he bent down and put his face in Peter’s, his eyes wild. With every word, spit would land on Peter’s face, and every jab vacillated between fury and despair. “I want to be dead because of you! I’ll kill myself and it’ll all be your fault!”
</p>
		<p> He remembered being 6 and wanting to be a dad so he could be as mean to his kids as his dad was to him. The insolent little boy walking down the street. A year later he had changed his mind. He wanted to be a good dad. He wanted to be the father his dad wasn’t. 
</p>
		<p> Father’s threats and grandmother’s death. She had taken her own life years and years before he was born. Why? Did she feel the same shakes when she got suicidal, that gripping anxiety that there are no options left, there’s no way out, with adrenaline pumping as the realization dawns on you that you are going to have to die, the vomit inducing weight of a future of pointless suffering, the final nail being driven into the skull as all your efforts will ever amount to nothing, Sisyphean loneliness, going everyday out and about and dreaming of participating in the real world only to fail again, but without even a name, born and die hated and without value under the shadow of everything people could be but you fail to, as he did? Is it just in their blood? Peter had heard that her mother would threaten to drown herself in the lake near their home every time anything went a little wrong, like the chicken being dry or the ice melted too soon. Cursed to be self-pitying, a sick humility twisted by narcissism. Maybe I should just be dead, die in silence. With these people he had never met, or tried to get away from, he had a shared past and wondered about his fate. Why did she have to do it? What was her world? Who was she?
</p>
		<p> Peter gave a little thanks to God that his parents died in a car accident. There was some relief in the fact that he didn’t have to live with the self doubt regarding his guilt and extent of the involvement in driving his father to suicide, and some happiness in the speed of it all - that his parents died nearly without fear, and without the hopeless abandon typical of his time at home. A strangely calm moment of peace in otherwise volatile lives - if it had to come to an end, Peter was glad they didn’t die of pain.
</p>
		<p> Still, there came a taste of bitterness in his mouth. 
</p>
		<p> Peter pulled up a picture of the three of them on his phone, a selfie as he was leaving for college. Each of them were smiling. Four years was a long time without them. To even speak to them.. just a little... like the old times on the phone, the year before they passed. Peter snorted at his thought, then smirked slightly and pulled a face to himself - there was never anything but yelling on those phone calls. 
</p>
		<p> I don’t regret spacing the calls farther and farther apart, he reminded himself. Nor did he regret lying to them about where he was, what he was doing, why he couldn’t pick up, even when he could. Any God or any person who would shame or damn me for doing what I had to do to... he thought to himself. His own little circle of Hell opened in his stomach, and began heating his blood like a stove. Pictures and voices from the past flooded his mind. Tears came to his eyes as he remembered the then small child who wasn’t allowed to speak to his father, the little boy, trapped crouching on the ground, incoherent screams raining down upon him, the one who first tried to kill himself by futilely strangling himself on the ground, writhing in silent hate for himself, his parents, and God, while out of sight and out of mind of all. 
</p>
		<p> Peter recoiled from his own thoughts. Is it weird to empathize with your past self as if it was another person? He couldn’t answer the question, but by Peter’s evaluation it was too dangerously close to self-pity to be worth more thought. Moreover he felt as though his ambivalence, his lack of the usual, incredible sadness, was a kind betrayal, a cowardly endorsement of their deaths, a single step removed from if he’d actually stabbed them himself. He made a face of disgust. He was glad no one could hear his thoughts. 
</p>
		<p> Peter sat back up, stretched, and looked out the window. Suicide was an old friend. It used to terrify him, as though Death was standing right beside him ready with the scythe, but the thought had become more of a nuisance, a small cut, a little nudge and distraction away from his passions. Still he bit the tip of his tongue - he hated self-pity. Tours of self-indulgence and narcissism. He closed his eyes again and blew a raspberry as he massaged his face. No more thinking. Just as he felt on the verge of sloughing off the squatting trace feelings of his mind’s detour, and returning to the real world before him, he looked up and out at an alien view. 
</p>
		<p> I wonder where Dad’s farm was.
</p>
		<p> Peter had known his father was from Iowa, but the thought of being able to visit the farm his father grew up on had never struck him as something he could do. The shack his father had been raised in was probably gone, rotted away, but the fact that it had actually existed hadn’t seemed a possibility. Built in the 1800s. Peter felt a stroke of pride, picturing the tiny farmhouse. He pictured his father and great-grandfather working tall, green cornfields, in blue jeans and t-shirts, sitting on tractors, and feeding their pigs, the teenager pulling the most horrible face as he went to the pens. Pigs are the worst, smelliest, animal known to man, Peter’s dad would say.
</p>
		<p> “I wonder if I can find it” Peter said out loud, staring at the street in front of him as it began to interconnect and intersect with more and more roads, roads he had never seen before, hundreds and thousands of different trips, as the roads became the routes his great-grandfather had driven his father into town to get a special present for his great-grandma, meet up with Sally Hawthorne, or Maggie Vandelay, or Beau Bright, or, all dressed up wearing the nice clothes, see the special band coming through town to play Mozart in the park. Places and people he’d never met, and yet believed in, came to breathe and speak within Peter’s mind as the town gained a history, an idyllic vibrancy in a past long past that nevertheless was a part of him. 
</p>
		<p> “I bet I can find it” Peter said, smiling widely, as he headed to his computer.
</p>
		<p> Peter had saved an email from when he was 18 from his parents with the login to an ancestry site. In case you ever want to look through old photos, the email said. Love you lots, Dad. He put his father’s old username and password in and navigated to the photo archive his parents had uploaded years before. The screen was quickly deluged in old pictures, blurry black and whites of his father as a child, shotty portraits of “grandma” and “grandpa”. He remembered his father pointing out the people in the pictures as he scoured the photos for any of the farm.
</p>
		<p> Scans of old documents, some only yellowed remnants of maltreated letters, started to appear as he scrolled. One by one Peter opened these, and, in a stroke of luck, found an address on a letter sent to his great-grandfather by his grandfather regarding his dad’s stay.
</p>
		<p> “Keep him” the letter said.</p>
		<p> Peter searched the address online and found the street, but the address itself was gone. There was, however, a commercial farm on the same road. It must have been swallowed up, Peter thought to himself. To be expected. It occurred to him that he had no idea who owned or took care of the property after his father had left Iowa - the stories about the rest of his family stopped with his father’s exit. </p>
		<p> Peter realized the farm was North of him - unlike the roads to the East towards Chicago, the roads North had been cleared, at least as far as the farm. Peter got up, put on his black overcoat, and headed back out into the white plains to begin his pilgrimage. He pulled up the address of the conglomerate on his phone, started the ignition, pulled out, and drove down the salt-white streets that laid before him anew.</p>
		<p> As he drove out of town, he passed by acres and acres of untouched snow, and not a single soul. The few trees didn’t sway, the wind left this place alone. Ditches that lined the road were filled with ice, and the few houses that there were, sat alone. Not a single bird lined the wires, there wasn’t a horse in a pasture, not a tractor in a field. The emptiness of this place, this world he had entered, in its total, still, silence, was a different kind of emptiness than Peter knew well. Emptiness that wasn’t part of a horrible alienation, but an emptiness that preserved the last bastion of a world erased, a world impressive in that it is silent still. He felt as though he was walking into the annals of the earth.
</p>
		<p> The quiet places of the world could be quite different from the lonely ones. Perhaps, it occurred to Peter, Iowa was forced to be an image of stagnation. The country needed it to be a place of stagnation. Keep people working the farms, keep them busy, keep them shipping off food to the rest of the country. All the while, the land that their families lived on, the shops they owned, the farms they had, were being taken from them by machinations unseen. Some people are free to rob. They offer freedom, but they don’t tell them what a Potemkin village is. Propped up, justified, decay.
</p>
		<p> As he came to the commercial farm, Peter spotted a large house sat unnaturally upon the enormous fields. Its gaudy, high sloped roofline, inconsistent windows, and more than anything, unreasonable size, gave Peter pause. His love of architecture sent doubts into his mind about the kind of people who would live in such a McMansion, the pinnacle of debauchery was spending an obscene amount of money on a building designed with the sole purpose of showing that you have a lot of money. Most of the house would undoubtedly be empty. Quite fitting, a totally empty inside. And it's not even belied by a facade - the face of the house tells you it's soulless! And more than likely lived in by whichever manager was put in charge of the now corporate farm, no doubt headquartered far away from here. </p>
		<p> Do I really want to meet the people who live here? Are they even going to say yes to me walking on their property out of nowhere? Peter considered parking alongside the road and wandering aimlessly across the field in search for the place the farmhouse sat. However, the thought of the people inside the house, camped up in the highest tower of their dungeon (for the stupid house had a tower) in an effort to try and make at least some parts of the home livable through the force of their presence, staring out, and already hiding from the dark uninhabited recesses of the house, they would see a man in a field, dressed all in black, wondering slowly and aimlessly. Their understanding of the outside world as undisturbed and unstained would be shattered. Terrified at this complete unknown, a break in the system, and, feeling the need to restore order, they would call the police, or simply shoot him. This thought dissuaded Peter. He decided to knock.
</p>
		<p> He parked in the driveway and walked up to the large, ornate, door. He knocked four times, in a slow beat, but was careful not to be too slow, as not to sound ominous. A minute passed. Peter rang the doorbell and knocked as well. After another minute passed, footsteps resonated through the walls as Peter spotted a man coming down the stairs. Descending from the tower, Peter thought to himself. </p>
		<p> A tall, relatively burly, man in a sleeveless shirt opened the door and looked down at Peter, face full of suspicion. There seemed to be a slight relief in the man’s expression that Peter was short and dwarfed by the doorway and the man.</p>
		<p> “Hi, quick question, some of the land for this farm used to be part of the McMann farm, right?”</p>
		<p> The man’s face didn’t change a bit.
</p>
		<p> “Maybe. Lots of farms used to be here.” He said sternly. The man yawned, slow and wide.
</p>
		<p> “My name is Peter McMann. I moved to Iowa a while ago and my dad was raised on that farm. Never saw it though. Do you think I could walk around the property, and look for where the farmhouse was?”</p>
		<p> The man’s face eased slightly. Part of his expression had been annoyance at being woken up from a nap, made worse by having to answer a stranger’s questions.
</p>
		<p> “Pretty odd time to choose to walk across the farm. Pretty cold.” The man said, eyeing Peter.
</p>
		<p> Peter didn’t have an explanation he could give the man offhand. It was strange. He looked out toward the fields and spotted the corn stalks jutting out through the snow.</p>
		<p> “Well, its real pretty out now with the snow and all, and it also means I won’t be interrupting any work y’all wanna do out there”</p>
		<p> “Pretty goddamn cold out there” the man repeated.
</p>
		<p> Peter shrugged.
</p>
		<p> “I like the cold”
</p>
		<p> The man stared at Peter’s face for a moment. A million reasons for why the man was staring popped into Peter’s head. See if he looks sane, if he looks like a vandal, to probe him for lies, to out him as a spy for a rival farm, to remember his face in case he needs to describe it for a sketch artist - “Short, glasses, weak looking” he might say to the detectives. Then he relaxed.
</p>
		<p> “Alright, but come in. The documents for this place are upstairs, including the list of the farms that were swallowed up, and where they were. I’ll go grab them. Get out of the cold”
</p>
		<p> “Oh wow, thank you” Peter said, surprised.</p>
		<p> “Ed Norton” the man said, shaking Peter’s hand as he entered.</p>
		<p> “Peter”</p>
		<p> Peter waited in the entryway and hugged himself, trying to get himself as warm as possible before trekking across the tundra outside. Ed came down the stairs.</p>
		<p> “Alright Pete, here you go, I marked the spot on this little map here. Farmhouse ain’t there anymore, of course, but that’s where it sat. There’s a small pull off where the beginning of the driveway was, that’s about it. Not much else to tell you where it was.”</p>
		<p> “That’s ok, that's more than I expected to get” Peter said.</p>
		<p> Peter stepped back outside as Ed got ready to close the door.</p>
		<p> “Stay warm” Ed said.</p>
		<p> “You too”</p>
		<p> “Oh I’ll be warm” he laughed, “I ain’t going out there”.</p>
		<p> The door closed and Peter looked at the map. He got back in his car and looked through the windshield back toward the house. Through the window he could see Ed’s near silhouetted figure point to the car, before Peter turned around and backed up. As he found the pull off, and went to turn, he hit a patch of ice on the side of the road and, being not too great at driving, the front left wheel went into the ditch, jerking the car forward and back as it dipped into and out the other bank, shaking and jostling his body. His eyes now wide open, Peter adjusted and pulled off.
</p>
		<p> “I hate driving” Peter told his Dad, “It's too stressful”</p>
		<p> “Get over it.”</p>
		<p> “I can’t, there’s like a physical thing to it. It’s like my arms are too short, whenever I turn to look for a car when I’m changing lanes or something, I turn the wheel at the same time, I can’t help it.” Peter demonstrated.
</p>
		<p> His father laughed.
</p>
		<p> “You just gotta go quick til you can do it” he said.
</p>
		<p> His father began to laugh even harder, bending over.
</p>
		<p> “That reminds me of Grandpa. Grandpa, you know, grew up before cars, so when he got a car, he didn’t have anyone teaching him or nothing - and believe me, he was real bad at it. One time, we were going to town, and Grandpa, you know, he was always all over the road, and this time we were hanging over on the right side of the road. No one else on the road, and its Iowa, you could see everything, and there was nothing. But Grandpa leaned over the edge of the road so much that he scraped a mailbox on the side of the road.” Peter’s father put his hands up in front of him as if he was driving. “Sure enough he goes: ‘what the hell was that’” and in one motion Peter’s father jerked his head over his right shoulder, and twisted his arms hard on the imaginary wheel the same way. “We went right into the ditch! Straight down into it” he said laughing.
</p>
		<p> Peter sat in the car and surveyed the landscape ahead. Golden rays cast themselves upon the crystalline field. The rows of old corn stalks stood side by side beneath the snow, interred, all the way to the horizon, bordered by fog.</p>
		<p> Peter stepped out into the frozen, barren wastes. The snow here was thin. The wind had begun to blow a little. A breeze travelled across and picked up the lightest dustings of snow from the top of the veil. That mist of ice danced upon the invisible ebbs and flows of the streams of air, twisting and turning about itself. The mist rose up and then stopped in midair; caught by the sunlight, a million brilliant stars slowly descended and came to rest upon the earth again.
</p>
		<p> A crow flew over Peter’s shoulder and sat itself on the field. Hop hop hop. Hop hop hop. It skipped around the field, unbothered by Peter’s presence.
</p>
		<p> In Chicago, when Peter would walk to class in the Winter, there would be bushes that would shake when the wind was dead. A million tiny finches would be hopping around inside little bushes just along the sidewalk. They’d chirp like mad as they hopped and shook, keeping each other warm in the coldest parts of winter by heating up their own bodies and coming together. Cheep cheep cheep, cheep cheep cheep, they’d call to each other, cheep cheep cheep, the bush would flutter, until you walked too close - absolute, instantaneous silence. Peter smiled at how cute they were, laughed at the idea that the birds were convinced they were good at hiding, and wanted to apologize every time.
</p>
		<p> The crow picked at the ground. It looked towards Peter as he took a step towards the edge of the field. It pecked at the ground one more time, then, having concluded its business, flew back the way it came. Peter turned as he watched it fly. As he did, his eyes came to fix upon the ditch behind him, and he had the feeling he had just passed beyond Malebolge. He turned back to the wastes as a breeze sent prickles across his skin. 
</p>
		<p> Peter walked to the edge of the field, and tried to spot where the house had sat. Turning back and forth, he guessed the distance, based on the old photographs and the map. He stood there for a moment, pausing at the edge of the place his family had lived and worked. Ice, fog, snow, and setting sun. Soon it’d be dark. He lifted his foot and set his boot down upon the untouched ground, breaking the seal.
</p>
		<p> He began with slow, measured steps, and looked at the ground ahead. His grandfather - dead at 28? Maybe he was older. Peter didn’t know. His grandmother? Dead at the same age? Peter didn’t know that either.
</p>
		<p> “Everyone had told me different things” Peter’s dad said, “Cancer, heart attack.. So you know it couldn’t be any of those. Finally someone sat me down and said ‘listen, your mother was murdered’. That’s what I thought for a long time. I brought her up to my great-aunt and she was almost flip about it. ‘No son, your mom killed herself. Her second husband Nate, that worthless shit, bought her the bullets, knowing full well she wanted to. That’s why people say she was murdered. But, no, she killed herself. She tried to visit one time, and I watched out the window as grandma told her she had to get back in her car and leave”. He had never lived with either of his parents. After the divorce, the two year old went with his dad’s parents, and they wouldn’t let her see him. His father was supposedly his guardian, but he built grain silos across all sorts of states, and hardly came through. When he would, he brought his belt. “Our town was about 300 people. I’d have to bike 10 minutes to go to the neighbor’s to ask for milk. You don’t know work, you don’t know what being alone is really like!”
</p>
		<p> Peter stopped. Right ahead had been the farmhouse. He tried to imagine a faint outline on the snow where the foundation and building might have weighed down this part of the Earth, a recession only obvious in the snow. But he saw nothing. The frozen sodden mud of shit and dirt gave up nothing. Then as he turned his head and took a step he knew beside his feet were the bodies of his family on the ground, ahead of him their phantoms going about their daily lives, working the fields and making dinner.</p>
		<p> His grandfather had died here. Close enough to it anyway. Pan of oil caught on fire. He picked it up, get it out of the house. Spilled it all over himself. Burned here. Fell to the ground. Dad saw him in the hospital. Boils and red skin. Then he died. Great-grandpa, grandpa, and dad. One watched his father die, the other his son.</p>
		<p> This had been the place his great-grandfather would go out with only a t-shirt on to work in the middle of Winter. 
</p>
		<p> Peter took a step onto the stage of pallid ground. Laid before him in his mind were the bodies of an entire clan, a family he had never known. Did he deserve to be here, mourning dead that he never met? He wondered about the difference between an intruder and a late arrival to a graveyard.</p>
		<p> A breeze blew past Peter’s ear, and he closed his eyes and listened closely. He yearned for the supernatural. A sound, a word, a voice, here in the land of the dead, he begged to hear any fading memory from his family one last time. All his secret prayers stirred. A chance to see if he needed to be redeemed, if they cursed him for his resentment, if they’d spit at him, or banish him, or if he was ok, or if he needed to do something.
</p>
		<p> But he heard nothing. There was only silence. He opened his eyes and looked at the field, flat as a board. The wind blew again, from across the field and beyond the fog. The sun was setting and the few trees shook.
</p>
		<p> He stood still in the empty field. All the misery his father had experienced, that his grandparents experienced, and his great-grandparents experienced, came face to face with his own experience. It hadn’t been as bad, he couldn’t know those things, but his still hurt. He bent down and squatted on his toes. He took off his gloves and lightly touched the snow. His father tried. He didn’t always succeed. But he gave Peter a better life than he had had. All his family had tried, all had failed, but they tried. All that was past was past as he knew what he needed to do. Though he made his first promise out of hate, and the second out of a, not malaligned, resentment for his life, Peter made a promise again as he had as a child: to be a better father than any of those before.</p>
		<p> The cold bit Peter’s fingers. His face had been going numb. He looked across the field, at the treadmarks he’d made, some steps measured, some erratic, some that he sank into, and remembered the promise. Now he promised it to his family, past and future. “I love you. All.” He stood up, turned back, and slowly sauntered towards his car. After a few steps, Peter paused, took in a deep breath, and blew out a small cloud. “Ok long enough”, he said, skipping back to his car to warm his hands.
