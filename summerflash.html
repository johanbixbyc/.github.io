		<p> 	My parents are fighting inside like they have for the 23 years that I can speak to. I don’t want to think of this time outside reclining as a sort of retreat, I was gonna anyway before they started. But I do also know that I only make matters worse with these sorts of things. Maybe that’s part of why I want to write - some sort of proof that I’m not cowering away from the difficult things and that I’m... doing something. Even if I don’t quite know what that is. </p>
		<p>	The breeze is blowing, happily, else it’d get a bit too hot. When it does stop I can feel the sweat start to seep out and slowly smother me as the sun burns my, admittedly pale, body. I wanted to spend more time outside this summer, and actually do it unlike all those years I never did. Years in high school, and college when I’d come home for the summer, wanting to do things outside with friends I at first didn't even have, only to spend it inside - only to watch as the Sun starts setting earlier and the weather cools, to feel like I'd let it all slip through my fingers, only then would I lay out in the Sun in the last week of August. The last week of July I’m taking as a victory.</p>
